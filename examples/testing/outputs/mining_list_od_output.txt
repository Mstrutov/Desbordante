Resulting dependencies for this table are:
['weight', 'days'] -> ['shipping cost']
['shipping cost'] -> ['weight', 'days']
['weight'] -> ['shipping cost']

Depenency [weight] -> [shipping cost] means that ordering table by weight
will also order table by shipping cost automatically. Let's order by weight: 

+----+----------+-----------------+--------+
|    |   weight |   shipping cost |   days |
|----+----------+-----------------+--------|
|  2 |        3 |              10 |      4 |
|  0 |        5 |              14 |      2 |
|  4 |        5 |              14 |      2 |
|  1 |       10 |              22 |      6 |
|  3 |       10 |              25 |      7 |
|  5 |       20 |              40 |      8 |
+----+----------+-----------------+--------+

We can see that shipping cost is sorted too. And dependency seems reasonable:
the more the package weights, the more expensive it will be to send it.

Order dependencies are called lexicographical, because ordering for multiple
columns is lexicographical. For example [shipping cost] -> [weight, days] implies
that ordering by shipping cost will also lexicographically order [weight, days]:

+----+----------+-----------------+--------+
|    |   weight |   shipping cost |   days |
|----+----------+-----------------+--------|
|  2 |        3 |              10 |      4 |
|  0 |        5 |              14 |      2 |
|  4 |        5 |              14 |      2 |
|  1 |       10 |              22 |      6 |
|  3 |       10 |              25 |      7 |
|  5 |       20 |              40 |      8 |
