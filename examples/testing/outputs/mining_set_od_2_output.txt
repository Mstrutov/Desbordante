Attribute symbols:

position -- 2
percent -- 3

descending ods: 0

ascending ods: 2
{} : 3<= ~ 2<=
{} : 2<= ~ 3<=

Dependency "{} : 3<= ~ 2<=" means that ordering the table by attribute
"percent" automatically entails ordering by attribute "position".
Moreover, this is observed regardless of other attributes, since the
dependency context is empty.

Let's sort it by attribute "percent".

Sorted table:
+----+--------+------------+-----------+
|    |   year | position   | percent   |
|----+--------+------------+-----------|
|  0 |   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|  5 |   2021 | director   | 10%       |
|  3 |   2021 | manager    | 35%       |
|  2 |   2020 | manager    | 40%       |
|  1 |   2020 | other      | 50%       |
|  4 |   2021 | other      | 55%       |
+----+--------+------------+-----------+

We can see that this sort entails automatic ordering by attribute
"position".

Dependency "{} : 2<= ~ 3<=" is similar to the first and means that
ordering the table by attribute "position" automatically entails
ordering by attribute "percent". This can be seen in the table above.

In other words, these dependencies indicate that the ordering of
percents entails an automatic ordering of the positions and vice
versa.

simple ods: 2
{3} : [] -> 2<=
{1,2} : [] -> 3<=

Dependency "{3} : [] -> 2<=" means that inside each equivalence
class from "percent" the constancy of the attribute "position" can
be traced.

We have 5 equivalence classes in "percent":
class [10%] with 2 elements
class [50%] with 1 element
class [40%] with 1 element
class [35%] with 1 element
class [55%] with 1 element
class [10%] with 2 elements

This table shows the constancy of values from attribute "position"
within each equivalence class from "percent". For clarity, lines
containing different equivalence classes are colored differently.

+--------+------------+-----------+
|   year | position   | percent   |
|--------+------------+-----------|
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | other      | 50%       |
|   2020 | manager    | 40%       |
|   2021 | manager    | 35%       |
|   2021 | other      | 55%       |
|   2021 | director   | 10%       |
+--------+------------+-----------+

Dependency "{1,2} : [] -> 3<=" contains 2 attributes ("year" and
"position") in its context and means the following: in the context
of one year and one position the constancy of percents is observed.
That is, in those tuples in which the year and position are the same,
the same percent value is observed.

The following table shows these observations.

+--------+------------+-----------+
|   year | position   | percent   |
|--------+------------+-----------|
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | other      | 50%       |
|   2020 | manager    | 40%       |
|   2021 | manager    | 35%       |
|   2021 | other      | 55%       |
|   2021 | director   | 10%       |
+--------+------------+-----------+

Consider the following two tables. In the first, dependency
"{1,2} : [] -> 3<=" continues to exist. But in the second one no
longer exists, since it is violated in third tuple, where the pair
(2020, director) corresponds to 20%.

Dependency "{1,2} : [] -> 3<=" continues to exist:
+--------+------------+-----------+
|   year | position   | percent   |
|--------+------------+-----------|
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | other      | 50%       |
|   2020 | manager    | 40%       |
|   2021 | manager    | 35%       |
|   2021 | other      | 55%       |
|   2021 | director   | 10%       |
+--------+------------+-----------+

Dependency "{1,2} : [] -> 3<=" no longer exists:
+--------+------------+-----------+
|   year | position   | percent   |
|--------+------------+-----------|
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | director   | 10%       |
|   2020 | director   | 20%       |
|   2020 | other      | 50%       |
|   2020 | manager    | 40%       |
|   2021 | manager    | 35%       |
